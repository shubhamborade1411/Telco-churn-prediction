# Telecom Churn Prediction

A project is basically to explain the customer will churn or
not in near future using different machine learning algorithms
like Decision Tree and Random forest.I have also designed a 
interactive PowerBI dashboard to asses the Churners profile on
 the basis of different parameters.
